            Hello, I'm Liev, a passionate UX Designer based in Tucson, Arizona. I entered this field to 
            follow in my fathers footsteps. I admired his career and sought to emulate it. Driven by a 
            passion for creation, I embarked on my journey into UX Design.
            <br>
            <br>
            My goal is to make a positive impact on people's lives through accessible designs. 
            I seek experiences that helps me grow and learn more, and hope to convey that in my work. Currently, 
            I am exploring front-end development to enhance my design skills with a deeper understanding of coding.
